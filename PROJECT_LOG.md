## CURRENT STATUS (As of August 9, 2025)

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Complete Flask Application** - All routes and endpoints implemented
2. **Full Agent System** - All 6 agents created with specific responsibilities
3. **Frontend Interface** - All HTML templates created with responsive design
4. **Styling Complete** - CSS styling for all components
5. **Docker Ready** - Containerization setup complete
6. **Documentation** - Comprehensive technical and project documentation

### 🔄 What's Partially Done
