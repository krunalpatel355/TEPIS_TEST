### August 9, 2025 - Pre Bug Fix: Trip Information Fields Not Displayed
- Preparing to fix bug where 'Duration', 'Category', and 'Price Range' are missing in the event detail page (only Start Date, End Date, Location show). Plan: update `event_detail` route in `app/app.py` so these fields are always present, adding helper logic after fetching event from DB if needed. Will log changes after code update so it can be reverted if desired.

### August 9, 2025 - Bug Fix Applied: Trip Information Fields Now Show on Event Detail Page
- Updated the `event_detail` route in `app/app.py`. Now, 'Duration', 'Category', and 'Price Range' are always set for the template after fetching an event, by:
  - Calculating 'duration' from `start_date` and `end_date` if not present.
  - Using 'event_type' or 'type' for 'category' if missing.
  - Deriving 'price_tier' using `get_price_tier_from_ticket_price` from 'ticket_price'.
- This ensures the Trip Information sidebar always displays all labels/values, even if the database event lacks some fields.
- This log entry tracks the exact logic added, enabling easy reversion/removal if needed.

### August 9, 2025 - Pre Implementation: Home-to-Destination Transportation Feature
- Preparing to implement new transportation feature that shows actual routes from user's address to event destination
- Plan: Add optional address field in trip planner, enhance transportation agent with Google Maps API integration, display results in new sidebar section above booking
- Transportation modes: Driving (with routes), Public Transit, Flying for long distances
- API Key: Google Maps API integrated with key provided
- Changes will be logged after implementation for traceability

### August 9, 2025 - Feature Implementation Complete: Home-to-Destination Transportation
- **Frontend Changes:**
  - Added optional "Your Address" input field to `app/templates/trip_planner.html`
  - Added comprehensive transportation display section to `app/templates/event_detail.html` sidebar above booking section
  - Shows route details with duration, distance, cost estimates, and step-by-step directions

- **Backend Changes:**
  - Enhanced `app/agents/transportation_agent.py` with new `get_home_to_destination_routes()` method
  - Integrated Google Maps Directions API with hardcoded API key: AIzaSyDriqtz6KB-2pSbCQ0zFNmwi5ZrhGZeDqM
  - Updated `app/app.py` event_detail route to handle user_address parameter and calculate routes
  - Added route caching (1 hour) and comprehensive error handling

- **Features Implemented:**
  - Real-time route calculation for driving, public transit, and walking
  - Automatic flight suggestion for distances >500km
  - Cost estimates per transportation mode
  - Step-by-step directions from Google Maps
  - Clean UI with route comparison and visual indicators
  - Graceful fallback when address not provided (feature remains optional)

- **Technical Details:**
  - Uses Google Maps Directions API for accurate route data
  - Calculates gas costs for driving routes ($0.12/km estimate)
  - Shows duration, distance, and estimated costs for each mode
  - Responsive design maintains existing UI consistency
